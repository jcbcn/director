# Step by Step

The steps you need to take to turn your custom embedded device into reality.

## Hardware

- Determine electronic components
    - Do you need NAND flash?
    - Do you need external storage?
- Get datasheets for chosen electronic components
- Design PCB schematics from datasheets
    - Determine how you will interface with your microcontroller - debug/flash ports
